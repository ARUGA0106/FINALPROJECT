problem statement.

Simba Safaris faces the challenge of providing a seamless and efficient bus booking system to cater to the needs of modern travelers. Traditional booking methods are often cumbersome and time-consuming, leading to frustration among users. Moreover, with the increasing reliance on digital platforms for various services, there is a growing demand for an online bus booking system that offers convenience, reliability, and user-friendly features. To address these issues and capitalize on the opportunity, Simba Safaris aims to develop an intuitive and robust online platform that simplifies the bus booking process, enhances user experience, and ultimately revolutionizes the way travelers plan and book their journeys.

Simba Safaris' online bus booking system leverages cutting-edge technologies and programming languages to deliver a seamless user experience. The system is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface. On the backend, php is utilized to handle server-side logic, while MySQL serves as the database for storing and managing booking data efficiently. Additionally, the system integrates RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between different components and external services.

Its my hope that Simba Safaris will emerge as one of the top solutions liveraged from software development scholariship  program organized by the PLP, thus  Simba Safaris not only address the problem in transport sector but also set a new standard for online bus booking platforms.
